## Chapter 05: Configure AWS CLI Keys   
 
Before AWS CLI installation , in terminal if we type   
   
> aws   
   
It will give - command not found   

Steps to install AWS CLI:   

1. click on  this link : [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)   
2. In the LeftNav -> getting started => Install/Update   
3. go to section **AWS CLI install and update instructions**   
4. Expand **macOS**   
5. Scroll to **Install or update the AWS CLI**
6. There are 3 options:
- GUI Installer
- Command Line Installer - All users
- Command Line - Current user

I followed GUI installer(downloaded .pkg file and next-next-next)   
once installation is done, in terminal type   

> aws   

It will show :
