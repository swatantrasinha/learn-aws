## Introduction to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud EC2   

### Compute Services:   

1. Processor   
2. Memory   
3. Hard Disk Drive or SSD   
4. Network Interface Card (NIC) - card that allow connecting to internet - can be wifi/wireless card/wired ether port etc    
5. Network Switch or Router   

 <ins>Note:</ins> Server is not our regular laptop   

### Virtualization
By virtualization we can install some software on top of some hardware in the machine and this allows the ability of virtualization  

Type1 & Type 2 Virtualization

The main key thing in virtualization is ***HyperVisor***      
- Hypervisor is an abstraction of the hardware      
- Virtual Hardware is given to the OS   
- Portability

 While connecting the machines using SSH, please remember to change file/key permission to 400(read-only)   
 **chmod 400 key.pem**   

### EC2- user data and meta data
- user-data: when we spin-up an EC2 machine, we are given a user box where we can enter some commands/codes and these commands/codes are called user-data. It will run only when the first time instance starts.    

- meta-data: information about instance. 
url for meta data is http://169.254.269.254/latest/meta-data   
   
curl then above url will show meta-data
