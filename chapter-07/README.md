## Chapter 07: Hands on Practice with EC2 machines   


Link to main page : 
[back-to-main](../README.md)



Go to previous chapter : 
[Chapter-06](../chapter-06/README.md)


Go to next chapter : 
[Chapter-08](../chapter-08/README.md)

 Go to [AWS-Console](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/console)
and search for EC2


Note: Any machine that we create lets say in us-east-1 region, the moment we migrate to other region say ap-south-1 those machines would be running but won't be shown as region is different. So machines are tied to region.

- in **Reserved Instances** we can get maximum discount

- images -> **AMI** : AMazon Machine Image   

- **Elactic Block Store** : determines what kind of storage will be used
