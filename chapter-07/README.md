## Chapter 07: Hands on Practice with EC2 machines   


Link to main page : 
[back-to-main](../README.md)



Go to previous chapter : 
[Chapter-06](../chapter-06/README.md)


Go to next chapter : 
[Chapter-08](../chapter-08/README.md)

 Go to [AWS-Console](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/console)
and search for EC2


Note: Any machine that we create lets say in us-east-1 region, the moment we migrate to other region say ap-south-1 those machines would be running but won't be shown as region is different. So machines are tied to region.

We can see in nevtNav the different option on EC2 page   

- one the option is **Instance Type**

- in **Reserved Instances** we can get maximum discount

- images -> **AMI** : Amazon Machine Image   

- **Elactic Block Store** : determines what kind of storage will be used 

Lets go back to  EC2 Dashboard  (in leftNav) and launch instance   
1. Click on dropdown next to Launch Instance Button

As We don't have any template to select, so directly click on **Launch Instance**    

2.
