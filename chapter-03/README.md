## Group, Role and Policy   
- Group is a way to organize user
- Policy defines permission   
- User can get permission directly or via group
- Roles are for delegation and are assumed
- With assumed roles, we can talk to other services

### <ins>Root User</ins>
- the email with which SignUp AWS
- has full permission and cannot reduce the permission(so better avoid using root user)
- should be avoided
- enabled MFA

### <ins>Creare New User</ins>   
- from root user we can create **new user**
- by default no permission
- can create around 5000+ accounts
- use policies and prefer groups
- ARN : Amazon Resource Name (unique name for resource)
- username/password or access keys

### <ins>Creating Groups</ins>

### <ins>IAM Roles</ins>   
- Roles are assumed by users/applications/services
- gain the permission of " **role** " only

### <ins>IAM Policies</ins>   
- Policies are JSON documents
- Implicitly denied
- Identity based(this is common) and resource based(only few services support this)
- AWS support 6 types of policies- see below screenshot

### <ins>Account Access</ins>
There are two ways how we can give permission/access to an account   
- AWS Console
- AWS API

### <ins>SCP (Service Control Policies)</ins>  
As we saw in **IAM Policies**  above, it limits the permission but do not grant the permission.
